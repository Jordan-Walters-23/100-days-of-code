**Today's Progress**: Fixed python program I was simplifying, the task is from CS50P course that I'm working through

**Thoughts:** The solution came to me as soon as I scanned through my previous code. I think this is because taking a break allowed me to look at the code with new perspective

**Link to work:** [Bank.py](https://github.com/code50/128825567/blob/main/py/week1/bank/bank.py)

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
