**Today's Progress**: Fixed the Python program that I was simplifying, the task is from the CS50P course that I'm working through

**Thoughts:** The solution came to me as soon as I scanned through my previous code. I think this is because taking a break allowed me to look at the code with a new perspective

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Python program that prints the media type of an inputted file name.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting used to taking a methodical approach to coding problems. I had to research the operators and methods I used. I tested a couple of solutions logically before Solving it.
