# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### <u>Day 0: August 22, 2023</u>
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the Python program that I was simplifying, the task is from the CS50P course that I'm working through

**Thoughts:** The solution came to me as soon as I scanned through my previous code. I think this is because taking a break allowed me to look at the code with a new perspective

### <u>Day 1: August 23, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Python program that prints the media type of an inputted file name.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting used to taking a methodical approach to coding problems. I had to research the operators and methods I used. I tested a couple of solutions logically before Solving it.

### <u>Day 2: August 24, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on a Python program that prints the media type of an inputted file name.

**Thoughts**: This task has made me work on my use of variables an learn how to carry them between functions, difficult but rewarding.

### <u>Day 3: August 25, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I focused on learning how to use 'in' and '.find( )' in condition statements  

**Thoughts**: There were a lot of learning moments, Times when a new method just clicked and my code ran correctly. It was valuable for me at my stage of learning to explore several ways to solve this problem.

### <u>Day 4: August 26, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I started Using conditions in my program, specifically while loops. I saw a forum entry that was focused on using while loops to count substrings within a string. This could be done easily with '.count( )' but it was an interesting exercise.

**Thoughts**: Programming is becoming intuitive and enjoyable for me. I see its value as a versatile problem solving tool.

### <u>Day 5: August 27, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I focussed on correctly organising the functions I created. I also added a 'bool( )' function to complete my program.

**Thoughts**: I had problems solving my program. But it's all learning and I notice that I manage the problems I face better each time.

### <u>Day 6: August 28, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on the freecodecamp HTML course in preparation for starting the "School of Code"


**Thoughts**: I'm looking forward to the "School of Code". I've done some HTML, Js, and CSS during the application process, as well as C and Python in my own time. So far I enjoyed learning different languages. It will be interesting to see what languages are best for the increasingly difficult tasks I solve in the future.

### <u>Day 7: August 29, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I completed the first section of the freecodecamp responsive web design course "Learn HTML".

**Thoughts**: Focussing on a front-end language required me to adjust my approach. It was easy to adapt because freecodecamp's course format was straightforward.

<!--**Link to work**: [Extentions.py](http://www.example.com)-->

### <u>Day 8: August 30, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on freecodecamp responsive web design course, today was the introduction to CSS.

**Thoughts**: This course was straightforward, just as yesterday was. I can see this course is designed to build foundational knowledge of web design. I'm looking forward to using it in projects.

### <u>Day 9: August 31, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the introduction to CSS and started learning how to use colour markers.

**Thoughts**: I noticed that I was getting the hang of writing HTML and CSS. I read the prompts and was able to recall the syntax.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->

### <u>Day 13: Sept 4, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Today was the start of my School of Code journey. We did some group coding in CSS as well as focussing on methods to learn efficiently

**Thoughts**: I was slightly nervous this morning. Some exercise got rid of all the nerves, I was calm by the time I started. It was nice to meet people from different walks of life that had a common goal.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->

### <u>Day 14: Sept 5, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: We practised using git commands to work from our team repositories. We used git clone, add, commit, push, pull, branch and switch. There were also some useful resources on W3Schools.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting increasingly more comfortable learning and coding in a team. It makes it possible to learn a subject from several perspectives because of the constant discussion.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->

### <u>Day 15: Sept 6, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Today at school of code we had a guest speaker that "Ira Rainey" that talked us through his journey in the tech industry. It was uplifting to hear the story of a successfull developer that didn't come from a degree background. We also did team excercises as several points in the day. In which we learned to use an agile aproach.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed the challenge of communicating detailed information to team mates. It made us think as one. The team was strong because we elevated eachother 

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->

### <u>Day 16: Sept 7, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: This morning we did group coding using HTML. one person was picked out of the cohort at a time to add a line. I also learned about MVP (Minimum viable product), this added to my knowledge of iterative design from previousse days. The focus is on building increasingly defined products, not parts of a project.

**Thoughts**: These subjects stretched my perseption of project planning and gave me new tools to use in a group build setting.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 17: Sept 8, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We had a guest talk from Site reliability engineer and School of Code alumni Dave Adams. He talked to us about his job progression after SoC. We spent the rest of the day in our first hackathon working in teams of 3 to create and execute an agile plan.

**Thoughts**: Today was challenging, the erge to make the project more complex or creative was always there. Regardless we stuck to the plan and built the funcional MVP first. After that we increased the specificity.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 18: Sept 9, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I worked through the Freecode camp Javascript tutorials to familiarise myself with the language. Then I looked on W3schools to read some examples of JS being used in HTML. 

**Thoughts**: Reading code examples was a useful exercise. I like seeing JS's function in real applications. 

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->

### <u>Day 19: Sept 10, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through the Freecodecamp Javascript tutorials. 

**Thoughts**: I think learning JavaScript is similar to learning Python. They are both straight forward languages to read

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 20: Sept 11, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today, we had a talk about giving feedback effectivly, some important pionts were raised. Then we got stuck into Javescript, we worked through the excersises set out for us in a GitHub repo, taking turns to share our screens and work through the problems. 

**Thoughts**: I had underlying nerves in anticipation of meeting my group for this week It was less so than last week, which is progress. working with my new team was great. We had some good discussions and bounced ideas off of each other. 

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 21: Sept 12, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we went through two Javascript workshops one based on loops and the other functions.

**Thoughts**: It was a different experience working through logic based problems as a group because of the multiple solutions that we came to.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 22: Sept 13, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today, we had a talk from two employees of an SoC partner company. One speaker was also an Soc alumni. It was reassuring to hear that the transition from the boot camp to a tech role was smooth and that the methods taught are used similarly in industry. We spent the rest of the day learning about and using arrays in JS.

**Thoughts**: Today's group coding clicked for me. Not solving every logical problem alone wasn't a disadvantage. I found I could follow the thought process of my teammates and use it to add to the next problem we faced.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 23: Sept 14, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We learned about objects today, we did things such as selecting a key value to log, changing an object keys value. Nesting objects in an object. Later on that day we tested out the skills we learnt.  

**Thoughts**: I had some computer problems today so i didnt get the opportunity to pick up as much as I wanted. Regardless, it was valuable. I'll be able to fill in my knowledge over the next few days. 

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 24: Sept 15, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today was our second hackathon. We were tasked with making a rock paper scissors game. We strictly focussed on our MVP then started adding some more desirable features. First we built  a 2 player game that compares choice and displays a winner. We proceeded to add a score counter and computer opponent.

**Thoughts**: Today was challenging. Despite that, I felt more confident with the task and pace of work. I apreciete the oppertunity to present each week, I hope to improve throughout my time on this bootcamp.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 25: Sept 16, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I designed the front end of a personal project, in draw.io. That way I'll have a clear understanding of what to code. I also worked through my team's Hackathon program, changing the code to find alternative solutions

**Thoughts**:  It was fun to do some visual design work. My time management could have been better today I didnt have defined goals to work to.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


<b><i>1 Day missed.</i></b>


### <u>Day 26: Sept 18, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learnt how to debug code. This was familiar to me from debugging my CS50 assignments. It was new debugging from the browser and a valuable lesson because that's ultimately where my code will be run.

**Thoughts**: Mondays at the School of Code are always exciting, It's when you meet your group for the week and begin to learn each other's working/learning styles, in preparation for the hackathon.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 27: Sept 19, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We pair programmed through some kata in Code Wars. Our focus was breaking the problem down to its simplest form, in pseudo-code. So it equaled one line of code or a simple Google search. We spent the afternoon changing the DOM of a webpage with js string methods. tomorrow we'll put this into practical use.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed practising breaking down problems with pseudo code. I found changing the appearance of the DOM difficult to get the hang of. It will come with practice and understanding its purpose.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 28: Sept 20, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We focussed on using events in JS to interact with the DOM and create some functionality on our web pages. Today's content answered a lot of questions from yesterday's topics.

**Thoughts**: I found this challenging. On the bright side, there were a lot of learning moments.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 29: Sept 21, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We were introduced to APIs and were given the challenge of using an API in our program with the fetch method, asynchronous functions, and "await response"

**Thoughts**: Today was another difficult day. This evening I've done further practice on the subjects from this week and will add them to my weekend study.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->



### <u>Day 30: Sept 22, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today was week 3's hackathon, we took on a lot of information. The challenge was implementing all of it in our project. We managed to use an API to display London's weather forecast on our web page.

**Thoughts**: I'm happy with the way I presented our team's project, preparation and reflection are what improved my presentation. I think we could have got further as a team if we thought collaboratively and built on each other's ideas.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 31: Sept 23, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I started building the HTML and CSS for a personal project. This will be the front end for a smart alarm product. It’s my first time building a mobile app. i’m looking forward to the process.

**Thoughts**: I spent some time Preparing for the weak a head by looking at some examples of front-end HTML and CSS for mobile apps. It was interesting to see all of the possibilities

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 32: Sept 24, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday, I did a recap on the subjects we covered this week. Then I carried on working on my personal project I built a toggle from examples I found and read.

**Thoughts**: It was Encouraging to build front end programs which resembled parts of apps I use day to day.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 33: Sept 25, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learnt about JSON files and Importing/exporting functions. We then did group coding in a workshop so we could practice. We made a function in a JS file that used an array of objects From a JSON file.

**Thoughts**: Today I was outside of my comfort zone just as the course intended. There were a lot of learning moments. For the first time, I used ChatGPT to clean up my code and explain it to me. It managed to pick up some of the simple mistakes I made.  On this occasion, our code was not too far from the correct solution and I've had my knowledge of syntax rules reinforced. 


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 34: Sept 26, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we constructed a module with helper functions that handled CRUD operations for an inspirational quotes application.

**Thoughts**: The tickets in this workshop were challenging for me, I paid close attention to the wording of each step. We came to a dead end and decided to rewrite the pseudo-code. After paying closer attention we found some changes we could make.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 35: Sept 27, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we built CRUD functions that manipulated HTTP requests sent to the API. I found it difficult for this concept to sink in. After a day of talking through it with teammates and attempting the code, I understood it enough to write part of one.

**Thoughts**: This is a concept I need to be persistent with. I'll keep chipping away until the idea sinks in.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 36: Sept 28, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learnt about and built route handlers with our REST API's, it's the first project we've done and built up over several days. The code calls the CRUD functions we created yesterday depending on the HTTP request it receives and responds with the function output.

**Thoughts**: It was rewarding to see a system we built over several days come together. I can't wait to use these Concepts in industry, as part of larger projects.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 37: Sept 29, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We completed our fourth hackathon. I noticed my presenting skills improving as well as my nerves. It's rewarding to refine a previously acquired skill and prove to myself I can still do it. Our goal was to make an  API that could process CRUD requests.

**Thoughts**: Considering how incomplete my knowledge of APIs was at the start of the week, I'm happy with the progress.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 38: Sept 30, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I created and worked on my branch of Friday’s hackathon. I'm in the process of debugging. Doing this has given me a better understanding of the entire program.

**Thoughts**: I feel more confident coding because of the daily effort I’ve put in over the last month. Debugging is less of a chore to me and more of a helpful iterative process towards an improved product.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 39: Oct 1, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I did some work to develop the front end of my IoT smart alarm app. I'm unsure which side of software I enjoy more. I'm excited to start the back-end and hardware part of this project.

**Thoughts**: My confidence in team programming as well as individually has been improving since I started the Bootcamp.


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 40: Oct 2, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we were introduced to Relational databases and SQL. We worked through some exercises on SQL BOLT to get familiar with the language. In contrast to the back-end software I've been working on this language was very accessible and read very similarly to English.

**Thoughts**: Today was enjoyable, it was nice to meet my team for the week. We got along really well and our learning styles complimented each other,  I think we’ll learn a lot as a team. 


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 41: Oct 3, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We carried on working through exercises on SQL Bolt to get more familiar with navigating SQL.

**Thoughts**: Working in a team is very rewarding, this week so far I've noticed I have reinforced my knowledge by talking through concepts with teammates. It’s been useful for filling in our blind spots within a subject.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 42: Oct 4, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: After learning about SQL over the past two days, we started working on a program in node.js using additional packages to manipulate the database from Are code editors. It was good to see the practical application of this technology and be shown how we can combine it with our recently acquired skills.

**Thoughts**: I felt very comfortable in the demos about the new Concepts we were learning, this would not have been the case two weeks ago so I'm glad to see personal growth. More recently I have noticed how challenging it can be to blend different working styles and also how rewarding it is to find commonalities and ways of working that we’re all happy with.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->



### <u>Day 43: Oct 5, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we built a database and API using elephantSQL and packages such as Express, Postgres and Dotenv. We tested by sending various requests using Thunder client. It was engaging to combine our SQL commands with awaited response variables.

**Thoughts**: We made good progress today and established that moving forward everything didn’t need to be learnt at once. Instead, our knowledge of a subject would be filled in throughout each project’s course rather than in a linear fashion. 


<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->



### <u>Day 44: Oct 6, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we did our 5th hackathon. The brief was an evolution of the last hackathon, instead of making an API that read from a JSON file we made one that connected to a SQL database using the pooling connection method. Within a repo, we created a file with a script that creates database tables and populates them with content.  We then started building functions and handler routes to manage requests sent from Thunder client

**Thoughts**: Today was the first Hackathon that I genuinely looked forward to. I enjoy the opportunity to measure my improvement each week.

### <u>Day 45: Oct 7, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed my team's hackathon project and made some changes to better understand the code. I revisited SQL Bolt to practice SQL database manipulation and looked through this week’s school of code quizzes to strengthen my weak points.

**Thoughts**: I wasn't looking forward to coding today due to other life stresses. Just coding something brought me into the mindset and left me enjoying the rest of my time learning. I'm glad this habit is taking root.

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 46: Oct 8, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I reinforced my knowledge of parameterized queries by writing code examples and depicting the concept visually in my notes. I also read the brief for the recap task I was set, we were introduced to the MVC design pattern and its advantages.

**Thoughts**: I'm becoming more confident with my methods of note-taking and breaking down the concepts that were initially complex, into small understandable pieces. I find drawing the concept in a memorable way to work for me. From my research, I’ve found that dyslexic learners remember images better than text.


<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 47: Oct 9, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learn about writing test code, the different types, and their uses. We practice writing test code using the vitest package in “node.js.” I finished the day by writing some HTML and CSS for a project I’m building outside of the boot camp.

**Thoughts**: It’s another Monday so I met my team for the week, we got on well. It was nice to work with new people. On the first day, we are always adjusting to each other's learning styles.

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->


### <u>Day 48: Oct 10, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Carried on with a workshop we started yesterday, it was focused on test-driven development. We followed the pattern of writing test code for the problem, then writing the minimal amount of code needed to pass that test, and finally refactoring our code meaning writing it more efficiently, while maintaining the same output/test results. 

**Thoughts**: I find this workshop more challenging than previous ones. The school of code staff are deliberately giving us less help on these tasks because the Independent problem-solving that we're exposed to is what will make us effective developers in the future. It's a surprising change but I welcome it.


<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->


### <u>Day 49: Oct 11, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learn how to write end-to-end tests. For this type of test understanding of the functional code isn’t needed because we're looking at how the user interacts with the front-end GUI. We made a test for a to-do list app that inputs a task. We checked the task had been added by using an assertion with a “.toHaveValue” method to check that our new value was stored.

**Thoughts**: Today was challenging for me, it's one of the subjects that I don’t understand very well right now. This one will take some work and several revisits.


<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 50: Oct 12, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we built test code for an API, it is also the first integrated test I’ve written. The tests for each endpoint were similar. The main structure was to set up a test skeleton, create a variable that stores a request to what we're testing and an assertion to compare the response to what we expected. As the endpoints we were testing became more complex we started to call the reset database function from a different folder so that we knew we were working from the same point each time.

**Thoughts**: This was another difficult day. Still, I'm optimistic about this subject and coding in general because I didn't understand what we were working on yesterday anywhere near as much as I do now. My knowledge is growing with consistency and time. 


<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 51: Oct 13, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: School of code week 6 complete. For our hackathon this week we were tasked with writing integrated tests for the API of a To-do app and an end-to-end test for the whole app. This task allowed me to practice using expect() to assert between an expected test result and the actual result. I also used various dot-notations to navigate to the front-end features through html.

**Thoughts**: I found the structure of today's hackathon difficult as it was not like the other projects we'd built, we were solely testing. I found the group presentations to be helpful because we gained a deep understanding of the other group’s project and essentially compared notes.

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 52: Oct 15, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked through exercises in js on exerism. It's not something I've been doing consistently. I will add it to my daily coding routine and see the benefit of consistent effort toward a single skill.

**Thoughts**: I have a lot I want to learn in software. So I'm embracing the struggle and taking one problem at a time.

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 53: Oct 16, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learnt about product-driven development and why it benefits companies and employees. I ended the Day by doing some more work on exercism, I like that it challenges my version of the solution and suggests alternative more optimal ones.

**Thoughts**: I've been thinking about what will drive me in this new profession once coding isn’t as challenging as it is right now. That's where the purpose of the projects I’m working on, their intention and impact, will be highlighted most.


<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 54: Oct 17, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we created surveys to aid in understanding a problem. We also built personas for the most likely individuals that would experience this problem. We were introduced to 
wireframe UI designs as a starting point for building a solution. I spent the evening working through katas on codeWars.

**Thoughts**: Code Wars is a good way for me to reinforce my JavaScript fundamentals knowledge using spaced repetition 

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->


### <u>Day 55: Oct 18, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we designed wireframes for our app ideas. We also had a demo about HTML and CSS design from the perspective of a UI designer. They built a low-fidelity wireframe with code and gradually refined the details Into a usable website. I continued with codewars this evening. 

**Thoughts**: This week I've had to think a lot differently as we are not working on a lot of functional code. We’re focusing on user experience, getting people's perspective and designing an optimal product.

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->


### <u>Day 56: Oct 19, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Our hackathon for this week spans over two days, We have been tasked with recreating the BBC sports page using HTML and CSS, As a stretch goal we can add functionality with JavaScript. 

**Thoughts**: It's nice to use a different set of skills, observing in a slightly different way. After a few days of finding a solution and wire-framing ideas, I can see how to define the problem and start to create the solution.

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 57: Oct 20, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we finished our two-day hackathon, We got to a point where our site looked not identical but similar to the BBC Sports home page. Most importantly we learned how to quickly build a wireframe and add detail with each scan over the page.


**Thoughts**: This week I experienced how effective it is to set guidelines for working practices within a team. It was harmonious because everybody agreed to the guidelines we set out for each other throughout the week.

<!-- **Link to work**: [SQL database API](https://github.com) -->



### <u>Day 58: Oct 21, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some HTML and CSS on a project I’m working on outside of the school of code, it was nice to use the working style I practised in the week to build a wireframe for my idea. I also spent some time on codeWars. 


**Thoughts**:

### <u>Day 59: Oct 22, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I continued the HTML and CSS for the smart alarm project I’m working on. I focused on the circular slider today. I researched and tested two methods. Changing the appearance of a slider with CSS, and using CSS and JavaScript DOM minipilation. I want to further explore the former option because it is closest to my current knowledge.

**Thoughts**: Between the two types of programmig I definitely feel more comfortable with dynamic languages compared to markup languages. I like being able to test the logic of my code.  I am starting to enjoy HTML and CSS more, the outcomes are impressive

### <u>Day 60: Oct 23, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We are in the planning stage of our mid-term projects so I didn't do any coding in the day. I spent the evening reworking the repos I did in previous weeks. I decided to focus on fetch and asynchronous functions. 

**Thoughts**: It's nice to see the growth in my knowledge. I haven't made the time to revisit this subject since a couple of weeks after first learning it but the understanding I've gained in coding since has helped me to grasp these concepts.

### <u>Day 61: Oct 24, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We started building the MVP for our week-long project. It consisted of setting up our back-end repo, installing the dependencies, and testing our SQL commands. This evening, I researched and tested CORS on a previous repo.

**Thoughts**: Today went smoothly, as a team we found our groove.  My intention is to maintain our healthy working practices.

### <u>Day 62: Oct 25, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked in the back-end team, for our week-long Project. We spent the day setting up our rest API, ready to connect with the front-end team’s repo, we will be using the CORS package.

### <u>Day 63: Oct 26, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we finished our POST request code in our API and familiarised ourselves with CORS middleware. The whole team came together at several points in the day to test the connection between the repos. There were some adjustments we needed to make so that our API could receive from and respond to the front end in the right format.


**Thoughts**: Working in a team of six has been more challenging. This is the first time we've needed to branch and merge to be able to work on a project simultaneously. To keep on top of people's changes is difficult. The time pressure of building our project in two days also adds some difficulty.

### <u>Day 64: Oct 27, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the morning by looking over the front-end team’s code to familiarize myself. This included making my own branch and trying to build additional features. I spent the rest of the day with my team at the School of Code preparing to present our midterm projects.

**Thoughts**: After an especially intense week of collaboration, I am happy with how the team came together and presented our finished MVP.

### <u>Day 65: Oct 28, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: After looking at the front-end team’s code from my midterm project,  I used codepen.io to understand and further build some code examples in HTML. Now I have a more rounded understanding of this week's Project

### <u>Day 66: Oct 29, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved an unfinished kata. I enjoy codewars as I  learn a lot from comparing my solutions to others. For this kata, I had to find a  letter grade for a number score. I understood the logic. The syntax is what tripped me up. Another kata solved

### <u>Day 67: Oct 30, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I ranked my understanding of the subjects covered in the last 7 weeks so I could practice my weak points. Our group found that we all wanted to Practice MVC design so we broke down the file structure then I wrote some code to fit each file's purpose.

### <u>Day 68: Oct 31, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: For the last day and a half, I’ve been doing a learning audit. I recapped some of my learnings from the last 7 weeks, mainly timer APIs, DOM manipulation and testing. I spent some time after the boot camp on codewars. Lesson of the day, Keep It Simple.

### <u>Day 69: Nov 01, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learnt about the history of deployment and how to deploy using host services like render and vercel. We then deployed our mid-term projects and altered our code by adding variables that store port and host information. I finished the day with some codewar kata.

### <u>Day 70: Nov 02, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we learned about AWS using their cloud quest game. We used S3 and EC2. Later on in the day, I managed to work on a kata in code wars. I am currently splitting my attention outside of the course between projects and codewars to prepare for Interviews.

### <u>Day 71: Nov 03, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We were set our toughest hackathon so far, make a full-stack app with CRUD functionality and a unique front-end. We decided to build a note-taking app with post and get requests. While doing this exercise we recognized how far we'd come from last week.

### <u>Day 72: Nov 04, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I made my own branch from this Friday’s hackathon and remade the UI so I could familiarize myself with grids in CSS and even listeners in JS. Next week we are being introduced to React.

### <u>Day 73: Nov 05, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today I revised subjects I've learnt over the last 9 weeks by working through the previous Repo workshops. After that I started a Kata in codewars. It was more difficult than usual and took more research. These challenges let me know I’m progressing.
