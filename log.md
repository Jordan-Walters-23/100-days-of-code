# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### <u>Day 0: August 22, 2023</u>
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the Python program that I was simplifying, the task is from the CS50P course that I'm working through

**Thoughts:** The solution came to me as soon as I scanned through my previous code. I think this is because taking a break allowed me to look at the code with a new perspective

### <u>Day 1: August 23, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Python program that prints the media type of an inputted file name.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting used to taking a methodical approach to coding problems. I had to research the operators and methods I used. I tested a couple of solutions logically before Solving it.

### <u>Day 2: August 24, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on a Python program that prints the media type of an inputted file name.

**Thoughts**: This task has made me work on my use of variables an learn how to carry them between functions, difficult but rewarding.

### <u>Day 3: August 25, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I focused on learning how to use 'in' and '.find( )' in condition statements  

**Thoughts**: There were a lot of learning moments, Times when a new method just clicked and my code ran correctly. It was valuable for me at my stage of learning to explore several ways to solve this problem.

### <u>Day 4: August 26, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I started Using conditions in my program, specifically while loops. I saw a forum entry that was focused on using while loops to count substrings within a string. This could be done easily with '.count( )' but it was an interesting exercise.

**Thoughts**: Programming is becoming intuitive and enjoyable for me. I see its value as a versatile problem solving tool.

### <u>Day 5: August 27, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I focussed on correctly organising the functions I created. I also added a 'bool( )' function to complete my program.

**Thoughts**: I had problems solving my program. But it's all learning and I notice that I manage the problems I face better each time.
