# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### <u>Day 0: August 22, 2023</u>
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the Python program that I was simplifying, the task is from the CS50P course that I'm working through

**Thoughts:** The solution came to me as soon as I scanned through my previous code. I think this is because taking a break allowed me to look at the code with a new perspective

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Python program that prints the media type of an inputted file name.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting used to taking a methodical approach to coding problems. I had to research the operators and methods I used. I tested a couple of solutions logically before Solving it.

### <u>Day 3: August 25, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I focused on learning how to use 'in' and '.find( )' in condition statements  

**Thoughts**: There were a lot of learning moments, Times when a new method just clicked and my code ran correctly. It was valuable for me at my stage of learning to explore several ways to solve this problem.

### <u>Day 4: August 26, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I started Using conditions in my program, specifically while loops. I saw a forum entry that was focused on using while loops to count substrings within a string. This could be done easily with '.count( )' but it was an interesting exercise.

**Thoughts**: Programming is becoming intuitive and enjoyable for me. I see its value as a versatile problem solving tool.

### <u>Day 5: August 27, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I focussed on correctly organising the functions I created. I also added a 'bool( )' function to complete my program.

**Thoughts**: I had problems solving my program. But it's all learning and I notice that I manage the problems I face better each time.

### <u>Day 6: August 28, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on the freecodecamp HTML course in preparation for starting the "School of Code"


**Thoughts**: I'm looking forward to the "School of Code". I've done some HTML, Js, and CSS during the application process, as well as C and Python in my own time. So far I enjoyed learning different languages. It will be interesting to see what languages are best for the increasingly difficult tasks I solve in the future.

### <u>Day 7: August 29, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: I completed the first section of the freecodecamp responsive web design course "Learn HTML".

**Thoughts**: Focussing on a front-end language required me to adjust my approach. It was easy to adapt because freecodecamp's course format was straightforward.

### <u>Day 13: Sept 4, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Today was the start of my School of Code journey. We did some group coding in CSS as well as focussing on methods to learn efficiently

**Thoughts**: I was slightly nervous this morning. Some exercise got rid of all the nerves, I was calm by the time I started. It was nice to meet people from different walks of life that had a common goal.

### <u>Day 14: Sept 5, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: We practised using git commands to work from our team repositories. We used git clone, add, commit, push, pull, branch and switch. There were also some useful resources on W3Schools.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting increasingly more comfortable learning and coding in a team. It makes it possible to learn a subject from several perspectives because of the constant discussion.

### <u>Day 15: Sept 6, 2023</u>
<!---##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Today at school of code we had a guest speaker that "Ira Rainey" that talked us through his journey in the tech industry. It was uplifting to hear the story of a successfull developer that didn't come from a degree background. We also did team excercises as several points in the day. In which we learned to use an agile aproach.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed the challenge of communicating detailed information to team mates. It made us think as one. The team was strong because we elevated eachother

### <u>Day 16: Sept 7, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: This morning we did group coding using HTML. one person was picked out of the cohort at a time to add a line. I also learned about MVP (Minimum viable product), this added to my knowledge of iterative design from previousse days. The focus is on building increasingly defined products, not parts of a project.

**Thoughts**: These subjects stretched my perseption of project planning and gave me new tools to use in a group build setting.

### <u>Day 17: Sept 8, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We had a guest talk from Site reliability engineer and School of Code alumni Dave Adams. He talked to us about his job progression after SoC. We spent the rest of the day in our first hackathon working in teams of 3 to create and execute an agile plan.

**Thoughts**: Today was challenging, the erge to make the project more complex or creative was always there. Regardless we stuck to the plan and built the funcional MVP first. After that we increased the specificity.

### <u>Day 18: Sept 9, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I worked through the Freecode camp Javascript tutorials to familiarise myself with the language. Then I looked on W3schools to read some examples of JS being used in HTML. 

**Thoughts**: Reading code examples was a useful exercise. I like seeing JS's function in real applications. 

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->

### <u>Day 19: Sept 10, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through the Freecodecamp Javascript tutorials. 

**Thoughts**: I think learning JavaScript is similar to learning Python. They are both straight forward languages to read

### <u>Day 20: Sept 11, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today, we had a talk about giving feedback effectivly, some important pionts were raised. Then we got stuck into Javescript, we worked through the excersises set out for us in a GitHub repo, taking turns to share our screens and work through the problems. 

**Thoughts**: I had underlying nerves in anticipation of meeting my group for this week It was less so than last week, which is progress. working with my new team was great. We had some good discussions and bounced ideas off of each other.

### <u>Day 21: Sept 12, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today we went through two Javascript workshops one based on loops and the other functions.

**Thoughts**: It was a different experience working through logic based problems as a group because of the multiple solutions that we came to.

<!--**Link to work**: [Name???](Link)-->


### <u>Day 22: Sept 13, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today, we had a talk from two employees of an SoC partner company. One speaker was also an Soc alumni. It was reassuring to hear that the transition from the boot camp to a tech role was smooth and that the methods taught are used similarly in industry. We spent the rest of the day learning about and using arrays in JS.

**Thoughts**: Today's group coding clicked for me. Not solving every logical problem alone wasn't a disadvantage. I found I could follow the thought process of my teammates and use it to add to the next problem we faced.

### <u>Day 23: Sept 14, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: We learned about objects today, we did things such as selecting a key value to log, changing an object keys value. Nesting objects in an object. Later on that day we tested out the skills we learnt.  

**Thoughts**: I had some computer problems today so i didnt get the opportunity to pick up as much as I wanted. Regardless, it was valuable. I'll be able to fill in my knowledge over the next few days.

### <u>Day 24: Sept 15, 2023</u>

**Today's Progress**: Today was our second hackathon. We were tasked with making a rock paper scissors game. We strictly focussed on our MVP then started adding some more desirable features. First we built  a 2 player game that compares choice and displays a winner. We proceeded to add a score counter and computer opponent.

**Thoughts**: Today was challenging. Despite that, I felt more confident with the task and pace of work. I apreciete the oppertunity to present each week, I hope to improve throughout my time on this bootcamp.
